Welcome to my github let me tell you a little about myself:
  I was born in Argentina, at a young age my family moved to Miami, USA where we lived for a little under 8 years and finally moved back to Argentina where i reside today.
  My interest in programmin began at 16 when i ejoied trying to modify simple games. After school i studied software engeneering at Universidad de Buenos Aires where i completed 2 years of study. Later I studies at Argentine University of Enterprise for 2 years where i learned the basics of software development. Finally, I compleated SoyHenry bootcamp and found my vocation as a fullstack web developer.
